    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <p>Join the group and type 'oi'. To sign up type 'join', to cancel type 'leave', to spectate type 'spec'.</p>

    <p> New tournament is started each hour. Five minutes before a group is created where you can sign up. When sign up close Tattoo will assign players to a team and launch the game. After the game Tattoo needs to know the score. When asking for it just type in the format redscore-bluescore, e.g. 6-2. Now is time for next round. Tattoo will assign players to team by order of tournament result. #1 goes to red, #2 to blue, #3 red etc. Since this is repeated there will be one winner at the end.</p>

    <p>Current result is announced after each game and can also be viewed here. No problem reading raw json? Right? Good!</p>

    <p>Note 1: that this is only a POC. From <a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/4066/proof-of-concept-poc">Techopedia</a>:</p>
    <blockquote>The overall objective of POC is to find solutions to technical problems, such as how systems can be integrated or throughput can be achieved through a given configuration.</blockquote>
    <p>Note 2: Tattoo has it has very limited functionality and known bugs. Consider helping evolve Tattoo with dev/test/community please let me know.</p>

    <p>Note 3: Tattoo can't handle duplicate names so make sure you join with a unique name.</p>
